### My bash scripts for various tasks

To run the scripts add them to PATH and run them from anywhere.
in .zshrc or .bashrc add the following line:
```bash
export PATH=/path/to/scripts:$PATH
```

Then call
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can call the scripts from anywhere.
eg. `remove_old_branches.sh`
